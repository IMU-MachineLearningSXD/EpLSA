the man died sad .
[MALE] enjoyed reading his book .
it was n't where i thought it was , and it was n't named what i thought .
[NEUTRAL] was unhappy when no one paid her .
he felt embarrassed for overlooking such a simple problem .
[NEUTRAL] she walked out with a half tattoo .
to his delight this helped him to play much better .
they could n't wait to do it again .
he loved his shop too much and would rather die than sell it .
[MALE] finally got his first plum three years later .

[MALE] and the friend stopped talking afterward .
[MALE] wound up having to work sick .
they let him go because they were so impressed .
within minutes it was mostly forgotten .
[MALE] felt it was a cathartic experience .
he finished and kept it anyway .
maybe i should be less picky .
she smiled awkwardly and walked away from him .
it still needed a preamp to connect to the computer , which delayed me .
it was incredibly refreshing .
she put her plan in place to get him to marry her .
we were glad to get rid of it .
it was not like the real thing but it was good enough .
[MALE] was never able to recover it .
the [MALE] family bbq was a big success this year .
