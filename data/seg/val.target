[MALE] spent hours trying to fix it .
they never spotted a snipe .
[NEUTRAL] she could feel the sand and realized she should wear shoes next .
the train conductor got him out .
[FEMALE] never wore the dress again .
they have since reunited for their sixth album .
then i thought it might have been the magnesium tablet .
now i feel sad when i think about them .
but [MALE] and [FEMALE] did n't experience that- they loved living together !
it got very cold in the water .
i sat back with my coffee and got to work , smiling .
he smiled and said hello .
he sadly realized that his sandwich tasted no better than fast food .
i quickly learned that saving money is very important !
luckily he got out safely and was perfectly healthy .
