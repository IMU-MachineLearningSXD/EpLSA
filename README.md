**Case Study**


We provide some test cases on three dataset.
In the example of abductive commonsense reasoning,  we aim to generate explanatory hypotheses when two observations are given: $O_{1}$ is the cause and $O_{2}$ is the effect. In this case, the semantic context of the $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ is that a cabinet is handmade. From the examples in Table Abductive Commonsense Reasoning , we can see EpLSA generates assumptions that include not only making it by hand yourself but also hiring professionals to do it, which is consistent with the contextual semantics and is highly diverse. The other methods appear to be heavily repetitive and frequently involve purchases.

In the explanation generation task, our purpose is to make explanations in the case of giving counterfactual statements. According to the generated examples in Table Story Ending Generation, the interpretation generated by EpLSA ensures reasonableness compared to other methods and correctly explains the willingness of not being able to make a campfire with rocks while avoiding the generation of duplicate results.

The story ending generation task is to generate a reasonable ending given a four-sentence story context. Examples of the generation of several methods are shown in Table Explanation Generation .  The results show that the EpLSA-generated story ending provides a remarkable summary of the narrative from a different perspective, encompassing the characters' emotions and driving experiences. The other models have different wrong summaries, such as "to the local zoo" of the MoE model.
